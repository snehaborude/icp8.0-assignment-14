      <b> <i ><u>LIFE</u></i></b><br/><br/><br/>
    Life is a quality that distinguishes matter that has biological processes, such as signaling and self-sustaining processes, from matter that does not. It is defined descriptively by the capacity for homeostasis, organisation, metabolism, growth, adaptation, response to stimuli, and reproduction. All life over time eventually reaches a state of death and none is immortal. Many philosophical definitions of living systems have been proposed, such as self-organizing systems. Viruses in particular make definition difficult as they replicate only in host cells.     The definition of life has long been a challenge for scientists and philosophers.[2][3][4] This is partially because life is a process, not a substance.
